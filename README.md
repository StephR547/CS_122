# CS_122
_**Course Description:**_

Introduction to data structures and the algorithms for manipulating them. Review of composite data types such as arrays and strings. The following data structures will be introduced: stacks, queues, linked lists, hash tables, trees and graphs. Topics include: the role of the abstract data type in program design, definition, implementation and application of data structures; recursion; use of time-complexity expressions in evaluating algorithms; comparative study of sorting and searching algorithms.

_**Student Learning Outcomes**_

Write programs that use each of the following data structures: arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and hash tables  
Implement, test, and debug simple searching and sorting functions in iterative and recursive forms
Explain how abstraction mechanisms support the creation of reusable software components  
Design, implement, test, and debug simple programs in an structured programming language  
Determine the time complexity of an algorithm
Describe the time-space trade-offs often required in algorithm design
Organize and express ideas clearly and convincingly in oral and written forms
